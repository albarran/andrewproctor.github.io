# Hello!

#### My name is Andrew Proctor and I'm a PhD student in economics at the <a href="https://www.hhs.se/en/research/departments/de/" 
  style="color:teal;">Stockholm School of Economics</a>####

I am especially interested in the application of structural and reduced form econometric
methods to better understand human capital acquisition and the determinants of labor 
market inequality.  

Since January 2019, I have been affiliated with 
<a href="https://www.sofi.su.se/english/" 
  style="color:teal;">Swedish Institute for Social Research (SOFI)</a>
at Stockholm University as a visiting doctoral student. I am also currently a 
visiting student at <a href="https://econ.duke.edu/" 
  style="color:teal;">Duke University</a> for the 2019-2020 academic year, with the 
support of a grant from the Jan Wallander and Tom Hedelius Foundation. 

Before starting graduate school, I worked briefly in nonprofit and government on 
community development issues, particularly homelessness.
