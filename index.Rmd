# Hello!

#### My name is Andrew Proctor and I'm a PhD student in economics at the [Stockholm School of Economics](https://www.hhs.se/en/research/departments/de/).####

I am especially interested in applying structural and reduced form 
methods to explore human capital acquisition and the determinants of labor 
market inequality.  

Since January 2019, I have been a visiting doctoral student at the 
[Swedish Institute for Social Research (SOFI)](https://www.sofi.su.se/english/) 
at Stockholm University. I am also currently a visiting doctoral student at 
[Duke University](https://econ.duke.edu/) for the 2019-2020 academic year, with the 
support of a grant from the Jan Wallander and Tom Hedelius Foundation. 

Before starting graduate school, I worked briefly in nonprofit and government on 
community development issues, particularly homelessness.
