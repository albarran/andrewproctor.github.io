# Hello!

####My name is Andrew Proctor and I'm a PhD student in economics at the Stockholm School of Economics.####
I'm in the second year of the doctoral program at the Stockholm School of Economics, where I focus primarily on labor economics and applied microeconometrics.  I am especially interested in intergenerational mobility and the determinants of labor market inequality.

Before starting graduate school, I worked briefly in nonprofit and government on community development issues, particularly homelessness.
